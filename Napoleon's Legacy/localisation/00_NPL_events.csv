EVTNAME19500;The Eastern Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19500;The British occupation is something most Afrikaners would prefer to forget about. With the British spread thin across the world, our settlers were mostly left to their own devices defending from the Bantu invaders. By the end of the Fifth Xhosa War of 1819, most of South Africa was controlled by Boer governorates and their provincial militias. Crippled by debt, the British government gave up their hold on Port Elizabeth and Cape Town and confirmed South African independence in exchange for a small sum of money and fleet basing rights. Rumours of gold, diamonds, and unlimited riches have led many to flee war-torn Europe for our republic. Some Boers have even decided to migrate further inland. On the other hand, overcrowding in Xhosa lands has culminated in yet another Frontier War-- the largest Bantu incursion into Afrikaner territory yet. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19500;The only way is forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME19511;Zulu-Xhosa Conflict;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC19511;The Xhosa have been slowly creeping into our lands ever since they were defeated by the white men. Some Zulu chieftains have already decided to take matters into their own hands, severely punishing cattle raiders and other good-for-nothings. Perhaps now is the time to escalate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA19511;They will tremble before our might!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB19511;Leave them be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4661999;The Bolivian Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4661999;The Bolivian government has always been quiet and has ignored our wars with our puppets and neighbors, but with our recent conflicts and struggles, they have decided to declare independence for Bolivia. We can either not allow this to stand, or set them free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4661999;We won't allow this injustice to happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4661999;If you love something, let it go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662000;The Claims of Bolivia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662000;Now that Bolivia ceases to exist, they can no longer contest the lands to the North actively. In their place we will claim the Northern lands they once did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662000;We claim the Bolivian lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662001;Border Dispute With Gran Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662001;The Gran Colombians have once again shot at our borders in Costa Rica, but this time they have gone too far and have killed multiple border guards. We will not allow this to happen again, and the only way to stop this is through military action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662001;We won't be seen as weak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4662001;We can't risk war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662002;Panama is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662002;We have defeated the Gran Colombians and seized Panama for our country. The Colombians will now be more careful when deciding who's borders to fire upon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662002;We welcome the people of Panama into our republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662003;Our Claim to Pastaza;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662003;We have claimed Pastaza since our independence, and the time to regain lost land is now! We have a chance to bring down Gran Colombia and show our strength and ability to be a regional power;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662004;Spanish Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662004;We have defeated the Gran Colombians and shown them the strength of Spain. The terms for peace were the secession of Pastaza from Ecuador and the limiting of Colombia to build an army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662004;Pastaza is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662005;Collapse of Gran Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662005;We are no longer able to lead Gran Colombia. Ecuador and Venezuela no longer have faith in our unity, having already left the federation. It is time to reinvent ourselves as Colombia. Maybe one day we can reignite the flame of Gran Colombia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662005;Viva Colombia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662006;Unification of Gran Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662006;The Central Americans and Peruvians were not able to defeat Gran Colombia in their imperialist wars to kill the federation. Due to these wars, the respective governments of Ecuador and Venezuela have agreed to centralize the federation in hopes of strengthening our position in South America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662006;The flame of Gran Colombia burns bright!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA99033;We accept those who come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662008;Liquidate the Hudson's Bay Company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662008;The Hudson's Bay Company has been troubled with severe losses throughout the early 19th Century. With shrinking demand for furs and the Hudson's Bay Company's failures to enter other markets, they have finally defaulted on their debts. The British Empire must take over all of their assets and debts in order to defend Canada from foreign militaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662008;They needed to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662009;A New Capital for Gran Colombia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662009;We have federalized our country, and have decided to choose a new capital for our country. What we choose will be our new capital for the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662009;Bogota is the only candidate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4662009;Quito provides an ideal Pacific capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC4662009;Caracas will make a great coastal capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662010;The Luccan Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662010;With the unification of Italy starting to gain speed, we have decided to choose the fate of Lucca, an Italian country under our control. We can either divide the country between the Papacy and the Kingdom of Italy with great boost to our relations and reputation, let the Luccans stay as they are, or annex them directly into the French Empire to make sure they try nothing suspicious;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662010;They should join their true family;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4662010;Lucca is fine as it is now;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC4662010;Lucca is a member of the French Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662011;Brazil Claims Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662011;With the recent loss of Rio de Janeiro to rebels, the realization by the Brazilian people that they can finally gain independence has come to them, and have acted upon our temporary state of weakness. We can choose to destroy them and solidify our control over the region, or give them the independence they really want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662011;We won't back down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4662011;We will grant them independence, but we want Guyana.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC4662011;They can have the entirety of the continent for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662012;The Guyanese Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662012;Guyana has had an offer to be purchased for an amount of 50,000. This can certainly be used for our expansion back into Europe, or to promote a rebellion in the isles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662012;We have no need for Guyana, we accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4662012;We can only afford to give half of our deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC4662012;The territory of Guyana is rightful British land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662013;A Partial Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662013;The British have come back to us with a partial offer. We can choose to get half of the colony for only 25,000 with their reasoning being that they still need a gateway to defend their African colonies. We can choose to either accept, gain nothing, or take it by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662013;We accept this offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4662013;This offer is trash!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662014;Negotiations Crumble;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662014;The British have offered us nothing! Our offer was appropriate and should have gone through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662014;There is nothing we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4662014;We will take this land by force!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662015;The Napoli Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662015;We have defeated the false claimants to the land of Naples. The pretenders being executed can no longer claim our land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662015;Sicily is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662016;The Sicilian Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662016;We have defeated the false claimants to the land of Sicily. The pretenders being executed can no longer claim our land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662016;Naples is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662017;The Orissan Court;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662017;Our meeting with the monarch of Orissa has gone terribly, with our ambassador mis-translating and insulting the family of their King. Attempts to correct this mistake have only made the problem worse with the Orissans now up in arms demanding the execution of our ambassador. The British Empire tells us to not give the ambassador, but we can choose to defy them and send back the ambassador.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662017;The ambassador is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4662017;The ambassador is theirs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662018;The Second Battle of Vizagapatam;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662018;Our military advisors from the British Empire have told us to attack from behind our border. They promise us this can end the war instantly, and grant the possession of this new land. We can definitely trust them thanks to this having worked in the First Battle of Vizagapatam against the French Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662018;We will do as we're told.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4662018;We'll defy the British and negotiate peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662019;Treaty of Calcutta;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662019;Our victory against the weak willed Orissans have brought us great power in the negotiations table. We've been advised to keep Vizagapatam for our own in order to finally reclaim India.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662019;Vizagapatam is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4662019;Vizagapatam is theirs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662020;Reclamation Westward?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662020;Our quest in reclaiming the lands of the Indian coast have been working so far, but if we are to control India, we will need to control the center of the Indian subcontinent. Our gateway into that land is through the small country of Bastar. Its negligable power is perfect for us to take advantage of. The only risk is upsetting the Hyderabadis, a large and powerful country in India.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662020;Onward to the west!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4662020;We shouldn't challenge the Hyderabadi dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662021;East Indian Company;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662021;Our government in control of the East India Company has gained some land in India. It would be wise to give the East India Company that land in their struggle to reclaim the Indian subcontinent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662021;This is appropriate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662022;Establishing a Friendly Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662022;The East India Company before the collapse had always had princes under our government, but not under our direct control. Through them, we could enact policies where the prince gained benefit and we did too, but at the cost of the populace. We have decided to restart that trend again, but we have no idea who to choose first and we can only choose one in order to extract the most profits. Should we install a friendly government in Nagpur or Bundelkhand? They are medium sized countries so we'll have to cut them both down a bit in order to connect to Vizagapatam. With a good bribe, we can do this now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662022;Bundelkhand is rich in food sources, they'll do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4662022;Nagpur is rich in dye, they're profitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC4662022;We want to coexist with the Indian countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662023;Isolation of Orissa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662023;Our growth into India has been contained into Eastern India, where we can administer land strongest. We are almost done in our conquest of Eastern India with the Kingdom of Orissa being the only country left. They are isolated politically, economically, and even socially. Even though they have the support of Hyderabad, it is only on paper. Now is the perfect chance to finish off Eastern India in the name of the East India Company!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662023;The Bay of Bengal is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662024;The East Indian Company Conflict;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662024;The East India company has been expanding rapidly in an odd fashion. They seem to be expanding around our country, slowly isolating it as if to form a choke hold on our country. Even our countrymen have noticed, with their cries to take action before the East India Company fully ensnares our country, bringing us down to their boots. We must take action now, or forever fight no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662024;They haven't done much, let's negotiate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4662024;They must be defeated by us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC4662024;Best to not anger the Company lion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662025;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Request;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662025;Apparently we have been expanding too quickly, having gained the attention of $FROMCOUNTRY$. Their diplomat said that the East India Company has been expanding around their country and slowly isolating them. Their only request is to create a buffer state under $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ surveillance. But the question is, why haven't they done anything to the French?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662025;Might as well listen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4662025;They think we are weak!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME4662037;Redrawing the Subcontinent;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC4662037;Our country's victory against her enemies has given us power to negotiate for the accomplishment of our desires. In order to further our ambitions as the sole hegemon of the subcontinent, we must act wisely as to not tarnish our legacy. Or we are not $COUNTRY$ men!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA4662037;We will punish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB4662037;We will emancipate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC4662037;We will accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86016;A Golden Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86016;We have recieved shocking news this morning. Our provinces on the European continent, subjugated as they are by France, have today risen up and joined the raging French Civil War. One side in the war has promised our people their lands back if they assist them in their fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86016;Let us return home as conquerors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA86017;Let us return home as conquerors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86018;The Noble Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86018;Thought the old nobility was abolished during the French Revolution, Emperor Napoleon I created a new nobility during his reign in the hopes of stabilizing his dynasty. As they have far fewer priveleges than the nobility of the old Kingdom, they have been relatively uncontroversial until now. A new faction in the Upper House, however, calling themselves the socialists, have begun attacking the institution, saying it represents a violation of the principles of equality that France should pursue. Their words are proving quite effective amongst our people, and the issue is becoming one of the largest concerns for our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86018;We shall have to think about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86019;The Debate Rages;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86019;The issue of the legitimacy of the Imperial nobility has taken over the political scene entirely. The socialists have proven very effective at spreading their message, and many people are now clamoring for an end to all noble offices, and some even for the abolition of the monarchy! At the same time, the nobility and its supporters have fought back, and are demanding that we guarantee their continued existence. Regardless of what we do, our actions shall have severe reprecussions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86019;Nobility is a graceful ornament to the civil order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB86019;Gradually eliminate the noble orders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86020;Anti-Nobility Societies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86020;Agitation by socialist parties has produced significant anti-noble sentiment in the raging debate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86020;Unruly scum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86021;Pro-Nobility Societies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86021;Agitation by reactionaries has produced significant pro-noble sentiment in the raging debate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86021;Backwards scum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86022;Republican Reaction;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86022;It seems that many socialists are no longer content with fighting the nobility, but now propose eliminating the monarchy itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86022;Let them try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86023;Bourbon Beliefs;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86023;It seems that many reactionaries are no longer content with keeping the nobility, but now propose restoring the Bourbon dynasty to the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86023;Let them try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86024;An End to Empire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86024;The event we have feared has come: the socialists and their ilk have risen against us and declared themselves the legitimate government of France. With the goal of establishing a Republic and overthrowing the Bonaparte dynasty, many Frenchmen have rallied to their call. There are many bloody years ahead for France. Be warned, though: a White Peace will not satisfy the people. Attempting to do so will lead to violence quickly starting again, until one side has reached 100 war exhaustion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86024;Vive l'Empereur!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB86024;Vive la Republique!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86025;The Return of the Bourbons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86025;The event we have feared has come: the reactionaries and their ilk have risen against us and declared themselves the legitimate government of France. The Bourbon pretender has landed upon French soil, and with the goal of establishing himself as the King of France, many Frenchmen have rallied to his call. There are many bloody years ahead for France. Be warned, though: A White Peace will not satisfy the people. Attempting to do so will lead to violence quickly starting again, until one side has reached 100 war exhaustion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86025;Vive l'Empereur!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB86025;Vive le Roi!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86029;The War Ends;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86029;Our people have been exhausted for far too long and have risen up and taken the capital. Word is coming around that they're surrendering in order to reunite the country once more and bring back peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86029;What a shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86030;The Lavender Terror;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86030;The Civil War is over. Victory was acheived on the battlefield, but many Frenchmen still favor the Republicans. We are seeking them out and giving them their fair due, and the nation is finally being reunited under the banner of the Bonapartes and the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86030;God bless Emperor Napoleon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86031;The Lavender Terror;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86031;The Civil War is over. Victory was acheived on the battlefield, but many Frenchmen still favor the Legitimists. We are seeking them out and giving them their fair due, and the nation is finally being reunited under the banner of the Bonapartes and the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA86032;We have a lot of work ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86033;The White Terror;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86033;The Civil War is over. Victory was acheived on the battlefield, but many Frenchmen still favor the Bonapartists. We are seeking them out and giving them their fair due, and the nation is finally being reunited under the banner of God and the Bourbons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86033;France is whole once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86034;The People do not Accept the Peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86034;Some in our government thought that the best way to deal with the Civil War was to make a temporary peace with the enmey in order to lick our wounds are rebuild our armies. Unfortunately, our people do not agree, and our armies have begun to reattack the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86034;There shall be no peace until France is whole once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86035;The People do not Accept the Peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA86035;There shall be no peace until France is whole once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86036;On the Verge of Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86036;The Noble Question has completely torn our nation apart. Our decision to keep the nobility has produced an extreme egalitarian sentiment from the socialists, and many of them stand ready to wage war against us in the hopes of creating a more equal society without a monarchy. However, a group of socialists has come to us and proposed a deal. If we make significant political and economic concessions to them, they will call off their dogs. Doing so will greatly strengthen liberal elements in our nation and anger conservative ones, along with making us look weak, but refusing will mean Civil War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86036;It seems we must accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB86036;We shall not sell our glory to such scum! War it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86037;On the Verge of Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86037;The Noble Question has completely torn our nation apart. Our policy of gradually eliminating the nobility has produced an extreme reaction from them and their supporters, and many of them stand ready to wage war against us in the hopes of creating a less egalitarian society with a Bourbon on the throne. However, a group of nobles has come to us and proposed a deal. If we make significant political and economic concessions to them, they will call off their dogs. Doing so will greatly strengthen backwards elements in our nation and anger liberal ones, along with making us look weak, but refusing will mean Civil War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86037;It seems we must accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB86037;We shall not sell our glory to these pigs! War it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86038;Our Nation, Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86038;Our brave brothers on the European continent have successfully navigated the sides of the French Civil War, and have gained independence for our territory. Unanimously, a Congress of representatives from them has decided to reunify with us. This is a glorious day for our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86038;We are whole once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86039;Our Nation, Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA86039;We are whole once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66649;The Union Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66649;Though we have generally pursued friendly relations with the British Union since our independence, one issue of contention between us has always been our treatment of the British and Protestant minorities within our borders. While we do our best to protect them, there are often many acts of violence committed against them by zealous Irish nationalists. Unfortunately, we have today recieved word that the Union no longer considers us to be doing an adequate job in protecting them, and is now claiming Northern Ireland as their own while preparing a military expedition to seize it from us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66649;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66650;Imperial Protection?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66650;News of the recent claiming of North Ireland by the British Union has reached the ears of our former tyrannical masters in exile. They have offered us an alliance against the Union in exchange for the ceding of a port to them so that their military can be stationed in Ireland and a recognition by us of Victoria as our Queen. Though we would retain full autonomy in such an arrangement, many feel that this is an intrusion on our sovereignty and that an agreement with the Empire would be no better than a deal with the Devil. Rerusing their help, however, will mean we will have little between us and the Union's might.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66650;Their protection would be most welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB66650;We make no deals with tyrants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66651;Imperial Protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66651;News has reached us that the oligarchic regime in Canada has attempted to take advatage of our recent dispute with Ireland by establishing a military base there and by forging an alliance with Ireland. It seems our attempt to establish ourselves there just got a bit more complicated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66651;Drat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66652;Imperial Acceptance;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66652;Ireland has proven to be wise enough to accept our offer of protection. They have agreed to recognize Victoria as the Queen of Ireland and have ceded a base of operations for our troops to us. Our future chances of retaking the Isles now look a bit brighter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66652;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66653;Imperial Rejection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66653;Ireland has proven to be foolish enough to reject our offer of protection. Our future chances of retaking the Isles now look a bit dimmer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66653;Drat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66654;Irish Overtures;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66654;Ireland has proven to be very disturbed by our recent actions in preparation for liberating the British population of Northern Ireland. However, rather than boisterously opposing us, they have today sent a delegation to negotiate with us in the hopes of peacefully resolving the situation. What shall we tell them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66654;They must stop persecuting the Protestants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB66654;Send them away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66655;Union Negotiations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66655;While the British Union has proven willing to consider abandoning their claims on Northern Ireland, their price is somewhat high. They demand an end to the persecution of the British population and an opening of the government to Protestants, which would mean an end to the dominance of the Catholic party. Refusing them, however, would surely mean an eventual war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66655;We accept their terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB66655;These terms are an insult!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66656;The Union Rejection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66656;It seems the British Union is unwilling to negotiate over their claims to Northern Ireland. It looks as though we shall have to prepare for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66656;Drat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66657;The Irish Rejection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66657;It seems that Ireland is unwilling to negotiate over the status of the British population of Ireland. It seems that if we want to protect our people, we shall have to do so by force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66657;Stubborn Irishmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66658;The Irish Accords;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66658;It seems that Ireland has accepted our terms concerning the status of the British population of Ireland. As such, we have withdrawn our claims, and our relations have been repaired. Ireland will remain a strong bulwark against the Canadian revanchists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66658;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66659;The Irish Accords;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66659;Though they rejected our offering, it seems that Ireland has accepted a compromise with the British Union and has repaired their relations with them. It will be difficult to establish a foothold in the region for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66659;Damned Potato-Eaters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66660;Protecting our People;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66660;Since we lost Ireland in the War of the Sixth Coalition, politics there have been dominated by the dictatorial Catholic Party, who refuse to allow the people any real say in the government and who brutally oppress the British and Protestant residents of the Island. While we have no desire to hold Ireland like the corrupt Hanoverians did, the persecution has grown so intense that more than half our government has come to believe that it will be necessary to intervene in Ireland for the sake of securing our bretheren's safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME66600;The Chill Australian Wind;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66600;Since the British Revolution of 1825, the former penal-colony of Australia has been one of the most fiercely divided regions of the world. Half of the population is strongly pro-monarchy while the other half is strongly pro-Union, and there are almost no neutrals. Acts of violence against the other side are common, and more than one man has been killed by a brother who supported the other side. Recently, however, the situation has gotten much worse. It is likely that within about three months, Australia will break out into a full-blown civil war between Unionists and Monarchists. The amount of division of opinion about the monarchy will likely prevent us from directly employing forces to quell the coming war, but we can start attempting to ensure our supporters win right now through a propaganda campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66600;Australia will be ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66601;The Australian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66601;As feared, the colony of Australia has erupted into complete violence. Supporters of the British Union have taken up arms against supporters of the Empire, and cities all over the continent are declaring themselves for one side or the other. While some in our cabinet are pushing for us to immediately land troops to quell the fighting, and thus treat this as a colonial uprising, many of our ministers urge caution. There are many in our Empire who sympathize with the Union, and it is feared that an armed intervention, unless the Union makes the first move, will lead to an eruption of disloyal sentiment everywhere. Instead, if we wish, we can covertly support our supporters in Australia, though the Union will no doubt be doing the same. The war will end when one side either conquers the other or reaches 40 War Exhaustion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66601;Caution may be the best policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC66602;As many predicted, the Imperial colony of Australia has erupted into complete violence.

EVTNAME121220;The Legacy of 1812;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121220;The War of 1812 shattered the fledgling United States of America. In the year 1816, British troops marched through the streets of American cities as the USA lost battle after battle with them. At the Hartford Convention that year, the Federalist-supporting, anti-war states of the North voted to expel the Southern and Western states from the Union and make peace with the British. Though the South fought to keep the Union whole, with both the British and their Northern brothers to contend with, their efforts failed. Since then, the USA continues to exist in the North, while the remaining states, under the control of the powerful Southern landowners, abandoned the Constitution and re-adopted the Articles of Confederation, granting state and local governments far more power. Yet many in both nations hope that one day, the Union will be whole once more. With the issue of slavery, firmly supported in the CSA and completely opposed in the USA, rising to prominence recently, many see the increasing divide between the two nations as proof of a coming new war.,;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME121225;The Commonwealth's Place in the World;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121225;After decades of humilation by Austria, Russia, and Prussia, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was restored with the help of the French in the first two decades of the 19th century. The Duchy of Warsaw, created from Prussian and Austrian territory stolen from Poland, was created after the War of the Third Coalition. After Russia's defeat in the Second Polish War in 1813, additional territory was added and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was declared to be reborn with Prince J?ef Poniatowski taking the name Stanislaw III, becoming King. But the War of the Sixth Coalition showed the reborn nation's precarious position. The old alliance with France has faded as a result of the peace, and the Kingdom is surrounded by unfriendly states. We must choose who will be our partner in foreign policy if we are to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC121226;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has sent a delegation to us asking for a return to the policies of alliance between France and Poland that existed under Napoleon I.

EVTDESC121264;For most of the 18th century, the East India Company was relatively tolerant when it came to race. We allowed Indians to breed with our soldiers and for most of them to hold moderately high military and political offices. However, a new wave of white supremacy has taken hold of many within our government. Indians now find the way to higher positions barred, and are forced to serve in lowly ranks for little pay. This has been especially prevalent in the military, where many of the Indian troops are complaining of their unfair treatment.

EVTNAME121279;An Indian Confederation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121279;The delegates have all arrived, and the discussion of India's future has begun. Two major views have quickly emerged as the possibilities for India. One is a more tame idea that the Indian states should merely promise to seek better relations and mutual protection in the future, an unenforcable idea. The other is that all of the states should unite under an Indian confederation led by the caller of the Congress. Though each state will retain its own autonomy in this arrangement, there will be a common foreign policy enforced as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME121280;The Birth of a Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121280;A majority of the Indian States have agreed that an Indian Confederation is the best means of ensuring stability and security on the subcontinent. As such, nearly all of the states are surrendering their sovereignty to us, and any that don't are rightly seen as legitimate targets of war to bring them into the new state.

EVTNAME121283;Leaving the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121283;Though it willingly joined the Indian Confederation, one of the member states has recently declared its independence and left the union. This has produced a political crisis over the matter of whether a state of the Confederation should have the right to leave the Union. As such, we have two options. The first is to decide that no one may leave. If we do this, we will announce a new doctrine of Federation for the Union in which the autonomous states will be forcibly incorporated directly into the administrative structure, forming a federation. We would also declare war on the trespassing state. Otherwise, we could let the nation go and keep trying to preserve the current system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTB121305;We must act to save our bretheren from the Prussian boot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121306;Danzig Under Prussian Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121306;The occupation of Danzig went smoothly, with only the Poles making a few feeble protests. Our troops are being cheered by the German citizens of the city as they march through the streets. Danzig is once more part of Prussia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121306;This time, forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121307;A Prussian Pomerania?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121307;Prussia has always desired Swedish Pomerania, and the recent rise of German nationalism has made the Kingdom of Sweden realize just how likely it is that they will lose this province in a war if they do not get rid of it peacefully. As such, they have today offered it to us in exchange for monetary compensation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121307;What a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB121307;That land is worthless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121308;Prussia Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121308;Prussia has accepted our offer. Our troops are withdrawing from Pomerania after an elaborate ceremony in which the Swedish flag was lowered and the Prussian one was raised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121308;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121309;The Integration of Pomerania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121309;The German population of Swedish Pomerania cheers our troops onward as we occupy our new possession. The elites have sworn loyalty to the King, and Swedish Pomern seems like it will be a loyal province of Prussia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121309;Our kingdom grows ever stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121310;The Poznan Uprisings;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121310;The German population of the Poznan Region and the nearby province of Torun have launched a major uprising agaisnt our troops in the region with the goal of reuniting with Prussia. Though they failed in Poznan, they were successful in Torun, and Prussian troops have moved into the area to occupy it. Shall we permit these dastardly Germans to steal our land without a fight?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121310;We aren't strong enough to fight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB121310;We shall secure all of West Prussia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121311;The Poznan Uprisings;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121311;Surprisingly, the Poles backed down without a fight after the German uprisings. Our troops have successfully occupied the lands of Posen and Thorn amidst the cheers of the German populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME121312;The Integration of Posen and Thorn;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME121313;A Prussian-Federation Concord?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121313;Now that we have unified the states of the Confederation of the Rhine, we have come one step closer to uniting all of Germany. However, the Prussian Kingdom has sent a delegation to us today asking to discuss long-term plans for German unification. Prussian conservatives are of the opinion that our nation, united under a liberal banner, stand for all sorts of Godless and repugnant ideas, and they want no part of it. As such, they ask us to make an agreement with them in which they will abandon all claims on German lands if we will agree to never seek Prussian inclusion in an eventual unification of all of Germany. Accepting would certainly make forming a German state easier, but many argue that a German Union without Prussia is not really a union at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121313;We accept- Prussia and Germany will remain seperate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB121313;We refuse- Prussia must be part of a German Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121314;The Bund Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121314;Wonderful news! The Rheinbund has accepted our offer. Both of us have agreed to abandon all claims on the other, and Germany and Prussia will now be recognized as a seperate nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121314;Now, to the East!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121315;The Bund Refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121315;Terrible News- The Rheinbund has refused to accept our offer. They insist that Prussia must be part of eventual German unification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121315;Revolting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121316;Prussia's Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121316;The emergence of the Rheinbund, a liberal union of most of the German states, has greatly affected the balance of power in Europe. No one is exactly sure how we should treat this new nation, especially since it is considered by many to merely be a stepping stone to eventual German unification. Otto von Bismarck, our new Minister President, advocates a policy of turning our backs on the rest of Germany, arguing that to embrace pan-Germanism is to embrace the dangerous ideas of liberalism and Jacobinism. He urges us to set up a conference with the Federation to negotiate an arrangement in which Prussia will forever abandon claims on other German lands in exchange for the Federation promising not to pursue a union of Prussia with the rest of Germany. On the other hand, many liberals within the government oppose Bismarck, saying that Prussia's future still lies in the West as part of a German nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121316;We don't care about Germany- call the conference!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB121316;The West is what is important, not the East!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121317;Prussia's Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121317;The recent attempt to create a liberal unification of the Rhine states has greatly upset the politics of Prussia. No one is exactly sure how we should respond to the increasingly vocal calls for German unification. Otto von Bismarck, our new Minister President, advocates a policy of turning our backs on the rest of Germany, arguing that to embrace pan-Germanism is to embrace the dangerous ideas of liberalism and Jacobinism. He urges us to announce a new policy of Prussia in which we will forever abandon claims on other German lands and seek a new course outside of Germany. On the other hand, many liberals within the government oppose Bismarck, saying that Prussia's future still lies in the West as part of a German nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME121318;The Tsarist Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121318;Since the Decembrist Rebellion in Russia of 1826, the legitimate Tsar, Nicholas I, and his descendants have resided in Prussia. With the situation in Russia coming to a boil, the current pretender has made us a deal as part of his preparations to reclaim his throne. When the uprising of the white forces begins, we will aid him by attacking Russia. If we do this, he promises, once he reclaims the throne, he will cede to us the Latvian and Estonian lands owned by Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121318;Sounds like a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB121318;It's too risky!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121319;Civil War in Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121319;Now that the Tsarists have raised the white flag over Moscow, we stand ready to fulfill our promise to the Royalist rebels. We will attack Russia and gain the Baltic in exchange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121319;Onwards to St. Petersburg!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB121319;On second thought...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121320;The Prussian Promise;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121320;Now that we have proved victorious in uniting Russia under the banner of legitimism, we are under the obligation to fulfill the promise the Tsarist pretender made in Prussia in his exile. In exchange for Prussian support in our fight, we promised them the Latvian and Estonian lands we own. Prussian troops are ready to march into these provinces the moment we sign them over to Prussia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121320;A fair deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB121320;On second thought...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121321;The Prussian Promise;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121321;The Tsarists have fulfilled their agreement to hand over the Russian Baltic to us. Finally, the German nobility there is reunified with their Prussian brethren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121321;The Baltic will be forever ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121322;The Prussian Promise;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121322;Despite what he promised us, the Tsarist bastard in Moscow refuses to agree to turn over the Baltic to us, arguing that the deal was not really his to make. We must teach him a lesson he will never forget!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121322;Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB121322;We can do nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121325;The Decembrist Schism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121325;Since the success of the 1826 Decembrist Rebellion, a coalition of liberal-minded army officers have served as the major power faction in the Russian government. In recent years, however, there have been increasingly strained relations between two factions within the Decembrists- the Westernizers, who wish to see Russia become more like the nations of Europe, and the Slavophiles, who, while supporting democratic reform and improved living conditions for the peasantry, believe that Russia must not embrace Western ways, but must instead rely on its traditions and agrarian spirit to thrive. The divide has finally reached the boiling point, and the two groups have formally divided into opposing parties. We can now take decisions to favor either faction for appointments in the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121325;Can't they just get along?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121326;Constantine I Dies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121326;Emperor Michael II, Tsar since the death of Constantine I in 1831, has today passed away. Though he was a staunch militarist, his desire to hold the throne kept him from protesting too much against the Decembrists' reforms. However, he had no male children, and in an effort to prevent the son of Nihcolas Romanov from inheriting the throne, his eldest surviving daughter, Catherine Mikhailovna, has taken the throne as Catherine II. This move has given the government even more questionable legitimacy, and many are now openly calling for a return of the "legitimate" Tsar in exile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121326;What's the worst that could happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME121327;The Decembrist Rebirth;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC121327;The Civil War with the reactionaries made many Russian intellectuals question whether the differences between Slavophiles and Westernizers was as great as it had first appeared. In order to resist to Tsarist propagandists, intellectual on both sides of the divide found themselves increasingly standing on common ground in support of a constitutional government that rules for the good of all citizens. After three years, this has culminated in the end of the schism, and both parties have again come together. Though they shall remain seperate parties, both have agreed to work hand in hand and not to attempt to sabotage the other through court intrigue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA121327;At last we shall have stable government!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32400;The Decembrist Legacy;The Decembrist Legacy;The Decembrist Legacy;;The Decembrist Legacy;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32400;On 26 December, 1825, a group of liberal army officers successfully overthrew the autocratic Tsar Nicholas I, replacing him with the constitutional Emperor Constantine I. Though the officers were inspired by the liberal principles of the French Revolution, they mainly succeeded due to the disgust of the more conservative officers with the tsars, whose conduct in the Napoleonic Wars they blamed for disgracing Russia. Now, more than ten years later, liberal government has largely failed to change the financial or military situation of the Russian Empire, and many are beginning to grumble for a return of divine and blessed autocracy. Constantine's death in 1831 and the subsequent placing on Grand Duke Michael on the throne further destablized the situation, and recent rumors of an ideological divide in the ruling Decembrist faction also serve as harbingers of the coming trials for Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32400;If only the Russian people were smarter, and not so Slavic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32411;A New Dark Age?;A New Dark Age?;A New Dark Age?;;A New Dark Age?;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32411;Attempts to compromise between the autocrats and the constitutionalists have failed. The forces of reaction have raised their flag under a tsarist pretender, and they are determined to restore the old ways by any means necessary. Russia now has a choice-- forward to an age of liberalism, or backwards into an age of superstition? We must now fight to defend the principles we hold dear, but be warned: A White Peace will not satisfy the people. Attempting to do so will lead to violence quickly starting again, until one side has reached 100 war exhaustion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32411;Long live liberalism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME32414;The Liberal Terror;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32414;The Civil War is over. Victory was acheived on the battlefield, but many Russians still favor the Autocrat pretenders. We are seeking them out and giving them their fair due, and Mother Russia is finally being reunited under the banner of Liberalism and Modernity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA32415;God Save the Tsar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32416;The People do not Accept the Peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32416;Some in our government thought that the best way to deal with the Civil War was to make a temporary peace with the enemey in order to lick our wounds and rebuild our armies. Unfortunately, our people do not agree, and our armies have begun to reattack the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32416;There shall be no peace until our nation is whole once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32461;A New Concordat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32461;Since 1801, relations between the Roman Catholic Church and France have been based on the Concordat of 1801, which gave France a great deal of leverage in dealing with the Church within its borders. However, it now seems that a newly appointed Pope with reactionary ideas has demanded that we re-negotiate the Concordat to allow the Church more power. If we agree to negotiate, our population and the rest of the world will see us as weak. However, if we refuse to negotiate, we may face the Church's ill will and maybe even the excommunication of the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32461;Perhaps we should be more fair to the Holy Father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB32461;Does the Pope forget that we once annexed his realm?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32462;Negotiations Begin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32462;The wise Emperor of the French has seen the validity of our complaints, and has proven willing to negotiate a new concordat. This is the day that the Church once more begins to reclaim its place in the world as the one true church!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32462;God Bless the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32463;Negotiations Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32463;It seems that the godless Emperor of the French has refused to consider changing the terms of the Concordat. This leaves us with a dilemna: we can back down, and lose prestige in the eyes of the world and the faithful, or we can excommunicate the Emperor. This option is risky, however, as we risk angering France enough to cause a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32463;Perhaps we shall wait for another day to discuss this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB32463;The Church has but one head. Excommunicate him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32464;The Pope Backs Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32464;Thankfully, cool heads have prevailed in our dispute with the Holy Father. He has agreed to continue accepting the terms of the Concordat of 1801.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32464;Even the devout can see Napoleon's wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32465;Excommunication;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32465;The fool that sits on St. Peter's throne has made a very unwise decision and has expelled our Emperor from the Church. While French priests will surely ignore the Pope's bluster, many in our nation are so offended by the actions of the Pope that they are calling for a re-annexation of the Papal States and French subjugation of the Pope, as Napoleon I did in 1808.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32465;Let us make the Pope just a Bishop of Rome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB32465;War against the Pope seems a bit extreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32499;Union Tensions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32499;When Napoleon invaded Portugal in 1808, the Royal court of Portugal fled to their colony of Brazil. Over the years spent in exile, Brazil was raised to the status of a co-equal Kingdom with Portugal and Rio de Janeiro became the new administrative and financial center of the Portuguese Empire. Even after Napoleon withdrew his troops from Iberia in 1813, the continuing tensions on the continent dissuaded the Royals from returning. Now that Portugal is largely secure, however, many of our subjects there feel that their interests are being sacrificed to the interests of Brazil and are pushing for the Court to return to Lisbon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32499;We shall stay in the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB32499;We must return to the land of our forefathers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32498;Society for Liberation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32498;Our decision to keep the capital of the Empire in Rio has not been met with much approval in Portugal. Besides unpatriotic and disloyal mutterings, there are even secret societies forming with the purpose of setting up a new King in Portugal and declaring independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32498;Colonial scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32497;Society for Liberation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32497;Our decision to move the capital of the Empire to Lisbon has not been met with much approval in Brazil. Besides unpatriotic and disloyal mutterings, there are even secret societies forming with the purpose of setting up a new monarch in Brazil and declaring independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME40000;The Haitian Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC40000;When First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte abandoned Haiti in 1804, he never forgot the humiliation his troops had suffered there. Even today, many feel that the time is right for us to take Haiti back as our rightful colony. The Haitians know this too, and so have offered us a large concession in exchange for us dropping our claims. If we accept, we lose our justification for taking the island back, but a refusal may reflect poorly on us in the eyes of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA40000;We accept this offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB40000;We will not drop our valid claims for a mere bribe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC40001;The French tyrants have accepted our enormous ransom, and have abandoned their claims to our island. Though it will take many years to recover from this blow to our treasury, at least French greed has been appeased with gold rather than blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA40001;B-b-but we could have been a First World country if we hadn't had to pay that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME40002;France Refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA40002;Come then, you frogs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32490;The Return of Greek Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32490;In the 1820s, the Greek subjects of our Empire began a massive rebellion against our rule. Thankfully, due to the weakened state of the Christian powers, infighting amongst the rebels, and the aid of Egypt, the revolt was crushed. Yet now, a decade later, Hellenistic sentiments continue to bubble beneath the surface of the calm in Greece. We must face the fact that another Greek rebellion is likely quite soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32490;We shall survive this storm, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32489;Greek Secret Societies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32489;Resentment against Turkish rule has led to the emergence of organizations pushing for complete independence for Greece from our Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32489;Barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32488;A Rising Greek Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32488;Since the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Greeks have labored under the rule of the despotic Turks. Yet in recent years they have begun to organize into circles dedicated to resisting the Ottomans and restoring their ancient nation. We have a chance to contribute to these movements, yet to do so would seriously damage our relationship with the Ottoman Empire. To not do so, however, would likely lead to resentment amongst our Hellenophilic classes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32488;Fund these heroes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB32488;We shall not aid those who contribute to disorder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32487;Foreign Funding for the Greeks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32487;It seems that we shall have to deal with more than the stubbornness of the Greeks in our efforts to retain our Empire's integrity. Disgustingly, the Greek Rebels are now receiving funding from Christian nations, increasing their effectiveness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32487;I doubt they will ever be able to pay that money back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32486;The Greek War for Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32486;News has reached us that the Greeks have organized an effective rebellion against the Turks and declared independence from the Ottoman Empire. It is likely, however, that the Turks will not be long in crushing this rebellion. If we wish, we can establish diplomatic relations with the Greeks and intervene in the war, though this would drastically hurt relations with the Ottomans. Our wealthier populace, however, seems eager to support the revival of Athens, and will not take a refusal to intervene very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32486;We owe much to the ancient Greeks. It is only fitting that we aid their descendants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB32486;They're not even real Greeks, you idiots!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32485;Greek War of Independence - Foreign Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32485;A great power has intervened in the Greek War of Independence on the side of the Greek fighters. They will only leave once the situation in Greece is resolved, for better or worse. The Ottoman Empire must win this war or else, the rest of the Balkans will open up to foreign intervention and strife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32485;Athens will be conquered yet again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32483;Our Ancient Military;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32483;By the Victorian Era, the military of the Ottoman Empire was extremely outdated. Though alliances with European Powers had helped somewhat, as had the abolition of the Janissaries in 1826, the Empire's capabilities were far behind those of the Christian Powers. Until we launch upon a large modernization effort, our military will suffer in comparison to those of the Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32483;Outdated? This is the same force that conquered the Romans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32482;Repulsed from Crimea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32482;We have failed to keep the Crimean Peninsula in the hands of our allies, and we must now pay the price for it. Our claims to the lands surrounding the Black Sea have lost all legitimacy in the eyes of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32482;Who needs the Tartars anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32470;Murat the Mad;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32470;Though the current King of Naples, Joachim Murat the First, was put on the throne by Napoleon, Murat chose to rebel against France in the Great War of 1822 in a bid for independence. Since then, he has grown progressively madder and more paranoid, reinstating absolutism and imprisoning or killing any who disagree with him. On the positive side, his vast collection of self-awarded medallions has aided the crafting industry significantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32470;All hail our beloved leader! Or else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA600042;The German War of Liberation begins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB600042;Perhaps this is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37245;We have defeated the French, and gained the freedom of many new German states who will look to join our country. Germany shall rule Europe forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA37245;The war is won!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66550;British Diplomacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66550;The British Empire has approached our diplomats with the proposal to negotiate over our claims to our former colonies in the Atlantic. While we may not like the Imperials, they may offer us a good deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66550;We shall hear their offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB66550;We shall not negotiate with oligarchical scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66551;Choosing Our Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66551;The French have proven willing to negotiate. We can generously give them back their colonies, which will surely improve relations between our nations greatly, or we can attempt to purchase the rights to their lands and get them to drop their claims. They may not be as likely to accept the second offer, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66551;Let us give back their colonies and bind our nations together in friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB66551;Would 100,000 pounds be enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66552;French Rejection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66552;Sadly, the French have been insulted by our offer and refuse to negotiate. Our relations have suffered as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66552;The bastards just want war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66553;A Generous Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66553;The British Empire have generously agreed to give us back our former colonies. Perhaps this is the start of a new era in our relations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66553;So long as I don't have to eat their food or love their women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66554;A Tempting Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66554;Unfortunately, the British Empire refuses to consider letting us have our colonies back. However, they are willing to compensate us generously if we agree to drop our claims to the islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66554;Better that we be paid in gold than we pay them in blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB66554;We will not sell our nation's honor for money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66556;The French Accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66556;The French have agreed to sell us the claims to the colonies. Our bankers are getting ready to process the transaction, and our diplomats are celebrating a possible aversion of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA66556;I guess one can deal with these people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME66557;The French Refuse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC66557;Sadly, the French have not taken our offer of compensation well at all, and have considered it an insult. It looks as though we shall have to prepare for eventual war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME86001;The End of the Coalition;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME86003;The Coalition Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86003;The Coalition of Nations has fulfilled their obligations in the French Civil War, and have now been given the freedom we so desire. The French have honored their deal and removed all claims on our country. A new dawn shines over the world, a world in which we are free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME86080;The Greek War of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86080;Emboldened by the funding from the Christian powers, the Greek subjects of the sultan have risen in rebellion against us. Though on their own they are weak, it is quite possible that powerful nations awash with romatic ideas of a free Greece will intervene to aid them if we do not put this rebellion down quickly. If a foreign power does interced, than making a peace with Greece will thus lead to us losing our claim to the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME86081;Greek Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86081;Today word has reached us that the Ottoman Empire has agreed to release a good deal of Greek territory as a free Greek state.

EVTOPTA86081;Long live free Greece!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME86082;Greek Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC86082;The combined pressure of the Greek rebels and the Christian Powers has forced us to agree to the establishment of a free Greek state. After long negotiations, the borders of this new nation have been drawn on the map, and we have abandoned all claims to the land. Today is an ignoble day for the descendants of Osman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA86082;We're better off without them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600023;The Reorganization of Austria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600023;Now that we have granted Hungary equal status within our empire, the state is launching a massive reorganization of the bureaucracy to adjust to the situation. The flags are being changed, maps are being redrawn, and Hungary's new Magyar government is being intertwined with ours. Peaceful, if a bit messy, days will be with us for a long time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600023;All Hail the Emperor and King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600024;A Return to Germanic Civilization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600024;Circumstances have led Hungary to leave the dual monarchy. While this certainly means a loss of power for our nation, many are welcoming the removal of Hungarians from our Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600024;What did they really have to offer us anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600025;The Hungarian Menace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600025;While Hungary has long been under the rule of the Hapsburgs, the lack of threat from the Turks have led many Hungarians to begin pushing for greater independence for their nation. While the situation is under control for now, our spies in the Hungarian nationalist movements report that if concessions are not made to Hungary within a few years, the Hungarians will likely revolt against us if our nation has become vulnerable from having a War Exhaustion score of 30 or higher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600025;Perhaps we should consider a compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600026;The Hungarian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600026;It seems our unwillingness to compromise with the Hungarians in our empire may have been a mistake. At our current moment of great vulnerability, a group of traitorous Hungarians has risen the flag of revolution, and will not rest until either Hungary is free or until they are dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600026;We will crush them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600027;The Claim to Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600027;When Napoleon invaded Spain and put his brother on the throne, few accepted him as the legitimate king. However, the true heir and his family were kept imprisoned by Napoleon until they died childless. As a result, the closest living relative happens to be the King of Sicily, due to a claim from Charles III of Spain. A delegation from the King has arrived today, demanding we recognize his claim to the throne and unite with Sicily as one nation. This seems like it might be the right time to restore the monarchy, but factions in the Cortes are divided. Some say we should offer him the crown on his own terms, while some say we should demand he rule constitutionally. Some radicals even claim we should refuse to submit to a European monarch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600027;He is our rightful sovereign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB600027;We demand he rule in a liberal fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC600027;Our destiny lies in the Americas, not Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600028;Gaining the Throne;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600028;The silly liberals in the Cortes have thrown away their principles in their desparation for a rightful king. Though our accession to the throne is technically in violation of the Treaty of Utrecht, few in Europe other than France care anymore about such relics. Taking the throne will also lead to us losing our claim on the Kingdom of Naples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600028;Never match wills with a Sicilian when a throne is on the line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600029;An Offer of the Throne;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600029;The liberals in the Cortes have shown willingness to make us King of Spain, but at a cost. If we wish to rule them, we must agree to accept a constitution for Spain. Further, an accession to the throne is technically in violation of the Treaty of Utrecht, though few in Europe other than France care anymore about such relics. Taking the throne will also lead to us losing our claim on the Kingdom of Naples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600029;Havana is worth some parchment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB600029;We rule by divine right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600030;The Royal Rejection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600030;It seems the decades away from Europe has gone to the heads of the Spaniards. They have denied our claim to the throne entirely and have decided to reject the House of Bourbon as legitimate rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600030;Liberal bastards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600031;The Royal Rejection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600031;It seems that for some, despotism is more valuable than legitimacy. The King of Sicily has refused our offer, and has decided to continue ruling as an absolute monarch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600031;Reactionary bastard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600032;The Deal is Done;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600032;With the King of Sicily agreeing to the demands of the liberals in the Cubano Cortes, Spain today has its rightful sovereign back on the the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600032;Onwards to Madrid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600033;The Death of Old Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600033;News has reached us today that the representatives of the old Spanish government in exile have today abandoned their claims to the Iberian Peninsula. As such, we are being recongized by the world as the only rightful Spanish government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600033;Long Live New Spain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600034;The True Spain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600034;Now that we are no longer a puppet of the French, calls echo from all over the nation for the re-unification of Spain and the return of the true government in exile. Giving in to popular demand will, of course, mean the end for our government, but refusing will surely not be taken well by the populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600034;We graciously surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB600034;WE are the True Spanish Nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600035;The Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600035;The illegitimate rulers of the Spanish puppet state have, thankfully, given in to popular demand and surrendered Spain to us. Today our nation is whole once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600035;Viva Espa?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600036;No Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600036;The illegitimate rulers of the Spanish puppet state have, sadly, refused to give in to popular demand and surrender Spain to us. It shall mean war before our nation is whole once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600036;We shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600039;Imperial Experts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600039;As a dominion of the British Empire, our people both suffer and benefit from our puppet status. Though we are not free to form our own foreign policy, the Imperial government takes an interest in our welfare, and often sends experts to help us modernize our technology so we can better combat those who would take our land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600039;What is this "wheel" they keep talking about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600040;The Capital, Occupied;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600040;The enemy has occuped our capital. The effects of this cannot be understated, as all over our nation, the populace is panicking. Rebel groups seeing a chance to overthrow the government are forming, families are fleeing wherever they can go to get away from the enemy, the infrastructure of the nation is shutting down, and calls for peace at any price grow louder each day. Until we retake our capital, the chances of this war ending well look grim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600040;We must continue the fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600041;The Capital, Taken;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600041;The enemy no longer controls our capital. The people are calming down, and life is returning to some state of normalcy-- at least, whatever can be called normal in a time of hardship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600041;Our sacred soil is ours once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600045;The Liberal Pope?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600045;In an event that has shocked Europe, the Papal Conclave of 1846 has elected Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti, a man widely believed to be a liberal and an Italian nationalist, as the new Pope. Taking the name Pope Pius IX, many in Italy see him as the possible head of a unified Italy. In the next few years, many Italian nationalists will look towards the Papal State to see if Pius really represents the spirit of reform Italy needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600045;Pius IX is indeed a reformer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB600045;Pius IX is more interested in spiritual matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600046;The Work of Redemption;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600046;Giuseppe Garibaldi, a general famous both for his skill in waging war in South America and for his radical Italian nationalism, has today shown up at the Papal Palace. Apparently seeing in Pius IX the figure of the man who will unify Italy in a Work of Redemption, he has offered to put himself at the head of an effort to conquer Italy under the Pope's rule through the raising of voluntary militias. Accepting could mean control over Italy, but it would also completely alienate us from the other Italian states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600046;For the Church and the Fatherland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB600046;This man seems a bit mad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600051;The Papal Plot;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600052;The New Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600052;We are hearing whispers that Garibaldi has conquered an Italian state. Let us see and wait what comes of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600052;Horrid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600054;A Present for Pius;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600054;Garibaldi was not all talk, it seems. One of the Italian nations has today fallen to his forces, and he has declared its immediate unification with us under the new national state of Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600054;Upon this Rock we shall build a nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600056;Building the Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600056;Garibaldi's forces have today conquered another state, and it has been put under Italian control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600056;God bless the man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600057;The End of Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600057;The experiment of liberalism and nationalism that was the state of Italy has today ended. No longer will anyone question the right of the existing Italian states to maintain their independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600057;Don't bother me with such petty news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600063;The Rise of the Redshirts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600063;Due to a recent liberal and nationalist surge that has occured throughout Europe, many Italians are increasingly seeing the current division of the Italian peninsula as a violation of the common ties of the Italian people, and the diverse Italian states as illegitimate. Such sentiments have lead to cries for a united and liberal Italy, and taking advantage of this situation, the famed freedom fighter Giuseppe Garibaldi has landed from exile in Italy. He is calling upon Italians to rise up against their government and estabish a united Italian nation, and is forming a militia of Redshirts to accomplish this. While a small state taken by him will likely simply lose its monarchy, if we find ourselves in a position of being a great power, we stand a chance at influencing Garibaldi to let us be the ones to lead this Risorgimento.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600063;Blasted liberals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600069;Repubblica del Popolo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600069;Garibaldi, acting as dictator for the provisional government, has determined that our nation is ripe for permanent republicanism. However, this is merely on a provisional basis, and if a larger state takes on the mantle of Italy, we will forcibly be inherited by them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600069;This is a humiliation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600070;Italia del Popolo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600070;Garibaldi, acting as dictator for the provisional government, has determined that our state is powerful enough to potentially unify the Italian peninsula and create, not an Italy of Caesars or of Popes, but an Italy of the People. As such, our new republic must now lead the fight against the other Italian states, who will surely wish to destroy us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600070;Long live the Italian people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600071;Garibaldi Takes Action;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600071;One of the Italian states has today fallen before the forces of Garibaldi and his voluntary militia of redshirts, and has been incorporated into his plans to forcibly unite Italy. We must prepare to fight against these forces and all their sympathizers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600071;May nationalism by damned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600072;Shackled to Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600072;Garibaldi, acting as dictator for the provisional government, has determined that our nation is to be linked to the newly formed Italian state. Our time as a free state is at an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600072;I don't want to be an Italian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600073;Long Live Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600073;Because of our dominant position on the Italian peninsula, Garibaldi, though a committed republican, has swallowed his pride for the sake of a united Italy and has appeared before us today, offering us his recent conquest and the mantle of the Kingdom of Italy. Crowds of tens of thousands have escorted him here, and throughout our nation, the cries of millions echo to God as our people praise the birth of a united Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600073;Long live Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB600073;I'll just take the land, thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600077;Italy, the Child of Napoleon;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600077;All over Italy, millions of joyous Italians are hearing of our quest to unify Italy, and are praising the name of King Napoleon and his great father, Napoleon I of France. Many are planning to join Garibaldi and rise against their state in the hopes of joining our glorious nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600077;Italy shall be ruled by true Italians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600078;Italy, the Toy of Murat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600078;All over Italy, millions of terrified Italians are hearing of our quest to unify Italy, and are cautiously praising the name of Murat the Mad while looking over their shoulders, as if someone is watching them. Many are planning to join Garibaldi and rise against their state, many simply because they fear the consequences of not doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600078;Italy shall be ruled by true Italians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600079;Italy, the Historical Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600079;All over Italy, millions of joyous Italians are hearing of our quest to unify Italy, and are praising the name of Sicily and of God. Many are planning to join Garibaldi and rise against their state in the hopes of joining our illustrious nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600079;Italy shall be ruled by true Italians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600080;Italy, the Baffling Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600080;All over Italy, millions of confused Italians are hearing of our quest to unify Italy, and are wondering aloud how on earth a nation that was so small a few decades ago is now the dominant Italian power. Many are planning to join Garibaldi and rise against their state in the hopes of joining us, though most of them are only doing so after getting horribly drunk and doing it as a bet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600080;We are NOT too pussy to join the Redshirts, man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600081;Italy, the Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600081;All over Italy, millions of joyous Italians are hearing of our quest to unify Italy, and are praising the name of our Kingd. Many are planning to join Garibaldi and rise against their state in the hopes of joining our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600081;Italy shall be ruled by true Italians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600083;Garibaldi's Call;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600083;After failing to fully unite the Italian peninsula around the midpoint of the century, Italian pan-nationalism lost some its allure, and few redshirts were to be seen. Now, however, a new generation of young men are again embracing the concept of a unified Italy, an Garibaldi has once more come into prominence, promising to once more recruit his voluntary militias to finally unify the Italian people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA600083;What a troublemaker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55000;The Frankfurt Assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55000;Admist the tide of liberal sentiment that has been unleashed upon the German states, calls by liberals for a unification of the German people have become especially prevalent. Huge demonstrations of pan-nationalists and a positive tone towards this action by the press occur almost daily, and it is feared that, whether the rulers of the German states like it or not, some sort of unification will be forced by the people. In response to this outpouring of support, an Assembly in Frankfurt has formed, made up of liberals dedicated to a unified Germany, and calls are being issued to all the nations to send delegates to agree to a common union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55000;What a headache.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55001;The Rheinbund;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55001;Enough states have sent delegations to Frankfurt to correctly say that a majority of the princes of the Confederation of the Rhine are in favor of unification. Thankfully, one of the Rhine states has recently emerged as the greatest among us, and as a first nation amongst equals, its ruler shall be offered the hereditary Presidency of the United Rheinbund.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55001;Deutschland ?er alles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55002;The Rheinbund;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55002;The Frankfurt Assembly has sent a delegation to us today. Apparently, more than half of the Confederation states have decided to support the unification of the German peoples, and as the predominant power amongst the Rhine states, the Assembly has offered us the hereditary office of the Presidency of the United Rheinbund. While accepting this would mean satisfying the liberal elements within our nation, along with considerable enlargement of our territory, many conservatives feel that the position they offer, and the liberal political constitution of the proposed state, is an illegitimate office, offered not by the grace of God, but by the liberal and unholy sentiments of modernity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55002;Deutschland ?er alles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB55002;Smells like a gutter in here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55003;The Rheinbund;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55003;Enough states have sent delegations to Frankfurt to correctly say that a majority of the princes of the Confederation of the Rhine are in favor of unification. Unfortunately, none of the Rhine states are currently prominent enough to be the obvious choice to lead a common union. As such, the Assembly has decided to offer the hereditary position of Presidency of the United Rheinbund to one of the German states outside of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55003;Deutschland ?er alles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55004;The Rheinbund;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55004;Recent pan-nationalist sentiments in the Confederation of the Rhine have led to an Assembly of delegates from the various German states that claim a majority of the princes of the Confederation of the Rhine are in favor of unification. Because none of the Rhine states are currently powerful enough to lead such a common union, the assembly has sent a delegation to us requesting that we take the hereditary position of President and Protector of the Independent and United Rheinbund. While accepting this would mean satisfying the liberal elements within our nation, along with considerable enlargement of our influence in Germany, many conservatives feel that the position they offer is an illegitimate office, offered not by the grace of God, but by the liberal and unholy sentiments of modernity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55004;Deutschland ?er alles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB55004;Smells like a gutter in here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55005;Joining the Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55005;The efforts of the Frankfurt Assembly have led to the creation of a union of the Rhine states under a heriditary President. While we did not support this venture, many in our nation, now having seen a union of the German people actually form, are now pushing strongly for us to join them. Doing so, of course, would mean an end to our sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55005;Deutschland ?er alles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB55005;We have no desire to join such a patchwork state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55007;The Failure of Frankfurt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55007;Just as the liberal sentiments of the Springtime of Nations has failed to produce any significant effect on our political system, so has the Frankfurt Assembly failed to unify the German people. Embarassed and despairing, the delegates to the Assembly are now slinking quietly back to their homes with their tails between their legs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55007;Serves them right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55008;The National Awakening;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55008;Due to the failure of the Turks to keep the angry and nationalistic Greek people within their empire, and viewing the restlessness of many of the Romanian nobles, the sultan of the Ottoman Empire has today extended the privelege of electoral election of a prince to Wallachia and Moldavia. People in both states are today celebrating their partial liberation from Trukish despotism, and are increasingly seeing themselves, not as subjects of others, but as fellow Romanians with a common heritage and culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55008;Long live the Romanian people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55009;The Personal Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55009;Due to increasing Romanian nationalism, the nobilities of Wallachia and Moldavia have decided that they must be seperate states no longer. As such, today they have elected a common Domnitor to rule over both nations, and the two provinces have come together as one nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55009;Long live Romania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55010;Das Kaiserthum Oesterreich;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55010;The Austrian Empire, after having escaped with the least damage of any great power in Europe after the Napoleonic Wars, seems a bastion of strength to the outside world. To the west, Italy and the Confederation of the Rhine are no longer French puppets, and in Eastern Europe, Prussia and Russia have been serverely weakened by war and civil disorder, while the reborn Polish nation has yet to make a mark on the world. Yet within its huge borders, the Empire is faced with many obstacles to overcome. The current Emperor, Ferdinand I, is mentally and physically impaired, and the Empire is really ruled by a council of arch-conservatives who oppose all efforts at reform. The huge number of minorities within the empire, many of whom resent our rule and are beginning to awaken to their national identities, spells even further trouble. While we currently follow the policies of Germanization and centralization established by Franz I, a time may soon come where a change might be preferable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55010;The Empire will always be German.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55011;The Nymph of the Dniester;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55011;In 1836, a group of Ruthenians published The Nymph of the Dniester, a collection of folk songs and stories published in the long-neglected Ruthenian language. The Austrian government quickly realized the threat of nationalism this might provoke, and banned the book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55011;Bloody peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55012;The Polish Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55012;Our spies in the Polish provinces of Galicia inform us that the Polish nobility there is attempting to stir up popular support for an uprising against us amongst the peasants, with the goal of joining the Polish-Lithuanian nation. The nobility is quite unpopular amongst the Polish peasants there, due to their harsh, serf-like treatment, and we might be able cut the problem off at the roots by funding an anti-nobility counterrevolution. Doing so, however, could lead to the peasantry realizing its power, and some say we should teach the Poles a lesson they will never forget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55012;A Gulden for every noble head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB55012;We'll show the Poles who is in charge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55013;The Polish Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55013;News has reached us that an anti-Hapsburg revolt has occured in the Polish provinces of the Empire. The rebels have come to us to petition us to aid them in their stuggle, with the goal of reuniting whit our nation. We could go to war with Austria to save the rebellion, but doing so would alienate us from every surrounding power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55013;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB55013;We cannot risk alienating our neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55014;The Polish Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55014;The Polish nation has issued an official declaration of war against us in an attempt to aid the Galician rebels and take the provinces for their own nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME55015;Poland Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55015;The war with Austria is over, our Polish brethern successfully stealing away the Galician provinces from Austria.

EVTOPTA55015;Long live Poland-Lithuania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55017;Resignation of Metternich;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55017;The wave of liberalism that is sweeping across Europe has hit us quite hard. Liberals in the near-powerless Diet have become increasingly vocal, and have demanded the resignation of Prince Klemens von Metternich, the arch-conservative who is widely believed to be the real ruler of the Empire. Realizing the danger he is in from increasinlgy loud and violent crowds in Vienna, he has resigned and fled the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55017;How will we run the country now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55018;The Vienna Baricades;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55018;The resignation of Metternich has only whetted the apettite of liberals in the capital, and news has reached us that rebels are taking to the streets and constructing barricades, threatening violence if the government does not embrace liberalism and constitutionalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55018;Quick, promise reforms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB55018;We will not bow to the will of a mob.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55019;Franz Joseph I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55019;The army has remained loyal to the crown, and has crushed the liberal uprising in Vienna with ease. Yet the generals of the Empire, who have been the real rulers throughout the last few months of chaos, have demanded a more stable regime to preserve the status quo. As such, the mentally unsound Emperor Ferdinand has abdicated in favor of the young Franz Joseph, who today takes the throne as Emperor Franz Joseph I, who is not bound by the promises of concessions made to the rebels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55019;Gott erhalte Franz Joseph!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55020;The Pan-Slav Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55020;In response to the German nationalism that has become so common amongst the liberals in Vienna, and due to our weakened grip over our Empire, our Czech subjects in the Kingdom of Bohemia have organized a Congress where all the Slavic peoples of Europe have gathered to discuss their common culture and plights. Nearly all of the Czechs are calling for some greater form of autonomy for Bohemia, with some calling for complete equality with the Austrian lands, and some of the radicals even calling for complete independence from the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55020;Czechs are supposed to pretend to be German!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55021;A Kingdom of Hungary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55021;Since the Hapsburgs inherited the Austrian throne centuries ago, many Hungarians have sought greater autonomy for their land, which the Austrians have been reluctant to grant. Since the end of the Napoleonic Wars, this desires has gotten increasingly stronger, and taking advantage of our weakened state, a group of Hungarians led by Lajos Kossuth has declared their intention to form an autonomous Hungarian nation with Franz Joseph to be elected as their nominal king. However, realizing this may mean civil war in the Empire, the Hungarians have presented a proposal to our government to abandon our policy of Germanization and stablize the Empire by dividing it between Austria and Hungary, who will work together as equals and fight under the same banner. While this polic is anathema to the arch-conservatives and the German nationalism of the liberals in Vienna, it is certain that refusing this offer will require us to use force to keep Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55021;Dualism is the way to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB55021;The Empire shall remain whole!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55022;The Kingdom of Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55022;It is a black day for the Empire. Our armies have been defeated by those of Hungary, and the peace terms dicated by them require us to cede all of the Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen to them, including those that remained loyal to us in the fight. On the bright side, however, Hungary has remained a monarchy, and the nobility has elected Franz Joeph as the de jure King of Hungary. Regardless, it will take time to recover from this blow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55022;Awful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55023;Reincorporating Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55023;Now that we have wisely re-embraced the policy of centralization and Germanization of our Empire, the delicate situation of Hungary, until now our partner in Imperial affairs, remains to be solved. While most of the conservative members of the government are advocating direct reincorporation, even if this may mean armed resistance from the Hungarians. However, some of the liberal, pan-German members at court are insisting that we should let the Magyars go in peace, and that our destiny lies in the West, not the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME55026;A Galician Diet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55026;While tensions with the primarily Polish and Ruthenian provinces of Galicia have always existed, after the failure of the attempted revolt against us 10 years ago, many of the Polish aristocracy in the region have moderated their demands. Today they have come to us hombly, putting forth a proposal of establishing a local Diet that will give them some autonomy from the Imperial government. Many in our government have responded positively to this proposal, alleging that it will greatly stabilize the region and allow us to focus on more pressing matters, and adopting this plan might be the first step in establishing a policy of Federalism and local rule throughout the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55026;This sounds like an excellent idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB55026;They are Imperial subjects, not free men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55027;The February Patent;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55027;With instability in the Empire growing, both from the ethnic minorities within our nation and the liberal elements in Vienna, many have insisted that Austria needs some form of constitution to steer its course. One such idea that is being proposed is the so-called "February Patent," which would greatly strengthen the Imperial Diet. However, since the national Diet is made up of primarily German-speaking subjects, the policy would necessarily involve a great weakening of all the local diets of the minorities throughout the Empire. Precisely for these centalizing tendencies, many of the liberals in our government are supporting it, while minority delegations are furiously protesting its adoption.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55027;This constitution will save our Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME55028;The February Patent;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55028;With instability in the Empire growing, both from the ethnic minorities within our nation and the liberal elements in Vienna, many have insisted that Austria needs some form of constitution to steer its course.

EVTDESC55029;With instability in the Empire growing as the minorities within our empire continue to fall sway to the siren song of nationalism, the Hungarian nobles of the Empire have today presented us with a proposal that they claim will solve our worries. Allowing Hungary independence from Austria save for military and foreign affairs and letting each side of the compromise deal with their barbarians in their own way, they claim, will ensure that Austria remains stable for centuries to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA55029;We need the aid of the Magyars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME55030;The Austro-Hungarian Ceremony;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55030;With instability in the Empire growing as the minorities within our empire continue to fall sway to the siren song of nationalism, the assistance of the Hungarians is increasingly valuable.

EVTOPTA55030;We are glad to have their help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME55031;The Hungarian Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC55031;Due to incredible militancy in Budapest and the current vulnerability of our Empire, the Magyars have today launched a full-scale rebellion against us. We must crush them lest they gain independence, or worse, seize more of our Empire than they already control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC55033;It is a black day for the Empire.

EVTDESC55038;Austria has suffered a horrible blow, as the revolt in Galicia against us has been sucessful. We have released the Poles from our Empire, and they have expressed their desire to merge with the Polish state. To the rest of the world, we must appear an impotent giant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Allowing Hungary independence from Hungary save for military and foreign affairs and letting each side of the compromise deal with their barbarians in their own way, they claim, will ensure that Austria remains stable for centuries to come.

EVTDESC55043;The Kingdom of Bohemia, long a possession of the Hapsburgs and one of the richest crownlands within the Empire, is populated by the curious Czech people, who have always struggled with their cultural identity between Germans and Slavs. Lately, however, anti-German sentiment seems to be on the rise, and to make matters worse, the Czechs are replacing the German ruling class of many of the cities in Bohemia. The recent elections for the Bohemian Diet confirm this, as for the first time ever, the majority of elected members are not German, but Czech. While they are divided between radicals and conservatives, all Czechs are pushing for a greater amount of autonomy within the Empire, if not outright independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When news broke in the United States, there were near-riots in Atlanta and demands for retribution on the New Englanders. With the situation destabilizing, the United States government has formulated an ultimatum, demanding the return of all fugitive slaves in New England, and the presence of the United States Army in Pennsylvania to ensure transit of all slaves. This can, and likely will mean war between the two countries, but not much can be done about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44160OPTA;Send the ultimatum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44161OPTA;Then Maryland will just become ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44162;Fugitive Slave War in New England;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44162;The war in New England has reached a boiling point with the war drawing ever closer near British borders. Many in the government are fearful that in the event of an American victory, there will be a new war in the future to overtake Canada as revenge for the earlier American humiliation in 1814. Envoys from New England have offered to make New England subordinate to the Empire, with the added benefit of the transfer of Maine to the Empire if the Empire intervenes and sucessfully defends New England from the Dixie hordes. This will certainly bring us to war with the United States, but perhaps this is a war of necessity when put in scope of the far greater conflict with the British Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44162OPTA;We must protect our allies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44162OPTB;We are not their babysitters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44163;The Defeat of the United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44163;The United States have been repelled and the State of Maryland has finally been liberated from the clutches of slavery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44163OPTA;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44164;The United States have been repelled and our agreement with the New Englanders will be upheld!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44165;The Defeat of New England;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44165;The New Englanders have been repelled and the State of Pennsylvania has finally been liberated from the clutches of liberalism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44166;John Browns Raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44166;An abolitionist named John Brown attempted to initiate an armed slave revolt across the South in $YEAR$ by taking control of the United States arsenal at Harper's Ferry in Virginia. Graciously defended by Colonel Robert E. Lee, he was able to capture John Brown. Under interrogation, it was revealed that John Brown was covertly supported by the New England government in an attempt to destablize the South, opening it for an invasion from the North. Dixieland is getting ever closer to erupting in total chaos, with John Brown broken out of his cell by a mob and lynched. The United States has formulated an ultimatum to the North, requiring a military presence in key cities to quell dangerous thought, the transfer of all fugitive slaves, and reparations to the South under threat of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44166OPTA;The North must be pacified!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44167;An abolitionist named John Brown attempted to initiate an armed slave revolt across the United States in $YEAR$ by taking control of the nearby United States arsenal at Harper's Ferry in Virginia. Ultimately failing, John Brown was captured. It seems that John Brown has claimed the New England government gave him direct support, which is preposterous. With these claims, the United States is in an uproar demanding retribution on New England. The United States sent us an ultimatum, requiring a military presence in key cities to quell dangerous thought, the transfer of all fugitive slaves, and reparations to the South under threat of war. These demands are unfounded and the clouds of war loom closer once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44167OPTA;Then war it must be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44168;John Browns Raid - American Civil War Starts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44168;Our demands have been refused by the Northerners and with the public mood heavily against New England, war is the only path forward. The two countries can no longer stay divided, one must be defeated to pave way for the United American States to become once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44168OPTA;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44169;War Between the Americas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44169;A conflict between New England and the United States of America have broken out once again over a failed raid attempt by an abolitionist in the North. Due to treaties declaring New England as a state protected by the British Empire, the Empire is now required to join in on this war;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44169OPTA;The South must be pacified!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44169OPTB;This is just another regional war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44170;The Fate of the Native Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44170;The Native Confederation is a point of contention between the Empire and two American states. New England is constantly agitating for the protection of Americans in Ohio from the Natives. The United States refusing to drop their claims on the lands of the Natives, may be open to a compromise, splitting the Confederation between the three parties. However, the Empire can just integrate the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44170OPTA;Send the offers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44170OPTB;The Confederation is British!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44171;The British Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44171;The British Empire have come over to the United States to resolve the longstanding issues with the Native Confederation. While many in the United States want the whole occupation of the Confederation, there are also those to just want nothing to do with the land, having been out of our control for more than just a few years. The offer from the British entails the removal of all American claims on the land of the Confederation with the transfer of the native territories Illinois and Miami to the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44171OPTA;Accept the offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44171OPTB;We have no need for this;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44172;The British Empire have come over to New England to resolve the longstanding issues with the Native Confederation. While many in the New England want a peaceful resolution to the treatment of Americans in Ohio, many just want nothing to do with the land, having never been in our control. The offer from the British entails the sale of the Ohio area, which contains near-all of the Americans in the Confederation for a low fee of 10,000.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44173;British Aggression in the Northwest Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44173;News has reached $CAPITAL$ that the British Empire have annexed the Native Confederation, who initially served as a buffer state between the United States and Canada. While the United States shares a border with Empire near Oregon and the Mid-West, the Native Confederation protected the core of the British Empire from the American army in the event of a war between the two countries. The United States can either go against this illegal occupation, potentially fighting a war over the land in the near future, or allowing the British to set their occupation in stone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44173OPTA;The land is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44173OPTB;The British can keep it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44174;American Civil War Ends;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44174;The American Civil War ended with the surrender of the Yankee government in $YEAR$. The union once sundered in 1816 as a result of the fleeing British Empire taking whatever action it could to ensure its safety in Canada, is now once again whole. While the union was restored, it was important for the United States to reconstruct the North to fit the new American lifestyle and most importantly, prevent secession from ever happening again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44174OPTA;The United States must rebuild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44175;The End of the American Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44175;The American Civil War ended with the surrender of the Yankee government in $YEAR$. Even though the British Empire intervened on the side of New England, it was not enough to prevent the United States' triumph over New England. The British Empire in their pursuit of the British Isles looked down on their Southern neighbors, thinking of them as yet another minor inconvenience, has been greatly disturbed. The country that was greatly humiliated in 1816 has returned and displaced the British Empire once again as the primary power in the Americas. The war was lost and it was time for the British Empire to pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44175OPTA;Maybe the America's aren't so safe after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44176;Anglo-American Peace Treaty - Eastern Americas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44176;The defeat of the British Empire in preventing the United States from conquering New England greatly changed the power dynamics of the continent. The British Empire having been defeated was required to make concessions to the United States for fear of a repeaat of the War of 1812, but this time the Americans would likely win. The Anglo-American treaty punished the British Empire for its meddling with the Americans and changed the face of the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44176OPTA;Return what we have lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44176OPTB;There is nothing more we want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44177;Anglo-American Peace Treaty - The Northern Border;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVT44179OPTA;The Caribbean will be American!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44180;The American Civil War ended with the surrender of the Dixie government in $YEAR$. In order to integrate the rest of the massive United States, various federal occupation forces are required in order to slowly integrate the regions of the United States. The proposed plan is to break up the United States into the Confederate States of America to the South, Louisiana to the Mid-West, Columbia to the North-West, California to the South-West, and the rest going to New England proper. Reintegration with New England will take time, but it is necessary in order for stabilty to cover the American realm. Once the country is reunited whole, it will be time for a new American Union State to prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44180OPTA;The Reconstruction period begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44181;The American Civil War ended with the surrender of the Dixie government in $YEAR$ to Yankee and British forces. Both New England and the former United States have been led to ruin. The British Empire is at a crossroads. To let New England reunite the United States could lead to a repeat of the War of 1812. On the other hand, it will be land controlled by an ally of the British Empire. The British Empire can either choose to let New England rebuild the Americas while the Empire focuses on the British Isles, or the British Empire must rebuild the Americas in the place of New England who will be integrated into the Empire as an equal. To integrate the New Englanders would require strong efforts, and would make the reconquest of the British Isles a goal that must be dropped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44181OPTA;Let New England rebuild the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44181OPTB;The British Empire will be the masters of the Americas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44182;The British Empire Concedes the Isles;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44182;The Monarchists across the sea have dropped all claims to the British Isles. With the Empire victorious in the American Civil War, it has decided to concede the British Isles in order to refocus their efforts on North America. Any land that is claimed by us, but is owned by them will be returned to our control as a show of good faith. This is the start of a new era for Union-Empire relations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44182OPTA;Hopefully they will stay there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44183;The British Cession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44183;Representatives from the British Empire have offered the United States lands south of the 49th parallel and some lands near the Minnesota Territory as a trade for the lands north of the 49th parallel owned by the United States. The land trade would resolve many longstanding issues with the definitions of the American border with the Empire, but given the history the United States has with the Empire, is it necessary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44183OPTA;The frontier will be simplified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44183OPTB;We do not negotiate with filthy monarchists!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7880761;Mexico Attempts to Seize Louisiana!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7880761;The logistical failures of the Mexican-American war may cost the United States more than it had expected. The war was prosecuted to gain land from Mexico, but now it will be prosecuted to defend the territorial integrity of the Union. If the war is lost, All American land west of the Mississippi will be lost to Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT7880761OPTA;We must fight on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7880762;The Seizure of Louisiana;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7880762;The invasion of Mexico by the United States was repelled with great defeat and humiliation on the side of the Americans. Not only were they defeated, the entire Louisiana territory was seized from them. While a great day of disaster for the Americans, this is a day for celebration in Mexico!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT7880762OPTA;The Mexican Empire is eternal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7880763;Control of the Cape;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7880763;With the conclusion of the Cape War in favourable terms, something must be done to prevent any future challenges to our control. More specifically, the issue pertaining to the presence of our former enemies nearby. To secure the frontier, threats at home must be pacified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT7880763OPTA;Secure the frontier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7880765;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7880765;Demands have been sent from $FROMCOUNTRY$ demanding for a transfer of French minorities to their direct control, citing reasons such as oppression and the ensurement of peace in the current era. While shedding off this land would only rid the country of unsupported minorities, losing the land would cost the country vast swathes of valuable land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT7880765OPTA;Transfer the land;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT7880765OPTB;It will remain ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7880766;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Transfer of Lugano;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7880766;Demands have been sent to $FROMCOUNTRY$ demanding for a transfer of French minorities from their direct control. It has been noted that the transfer of land populated by Italians has been guaranteed to $COUNTRY$ as well, all that is necessary is to accept this guarantee to move forward in the transfer of the land to $COUTNRY$ control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT7880766OPTA;Accept the guarantee;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT7880766OPTB;We don't want this;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME7880767;Spain Revolts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC7880767;The Spanish at Madrid have mutinied against French control and are starting a war to gain their independence from the French Empire. It seems that the bonds made during the Peninsular War did not mean much to the traitorous nobles in Spain. Should Spain be taught a lesson or let go?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT7880767OPTA;War it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT7880767OPTB;If you love something, let it go;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME600037;Independence From France?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC600037;The time may come for the Spanish to free themselves from the French grip on the country that has been there for decades. The French, fighting a civil war will be unlikely to attack lest they open up another front in the war. The time for Spanish independence may be now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
